<h2>Help</h2>


<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>As you can see on the following image, the screen is divided in 2 parts. On the right the menu, which will always be here, and on the right the section you are currently working on.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/overview.png" alt="Overview"></p>

<p>At the top of the menu, you can see who you are logged-in as and then the sections you can work on. This usually reflects as much as possible the sections or pages of your website.</p>

<h1>Sub-Sections</h1>

<p>If you click on one of the sections in the menu and get a page like the following, this is a sub-section.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/sub-section.png" alt="Sub-section"></p>

<p>This will list the sub-sections you can work on. Just click on the sub-section you wish to work on and follow the journey.</p>

<h1>List Pages</h1>

<p>When you have reached a page like the following, this is a list page.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/list.png" alt="List"></p>

<p>This can be a list of articles, a list of users or a list of contact details. The presentation will always be similar.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/document.png" alt="Document"></p>

<p>You will see a relevant title, a relevant image (if there is one), and buttons for actions.</p>

<p>The "edit" button is the most important. It allows you to edit the information of this entry.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/edit-button.png" alt="Edit Button"></p>

<p>The "delete" button allows you to delete the entry.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/delete-button.png" alt="Delete Button"></p>

<p>While being irreversible and potentially dangerous, the Bureau will warn you and give you the opportunity to cancel before proceeding.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/delete-warning.png" alt="Delete Warning"></p>

<p>This symbol with 3 spots is a handle. It lets you re-order the documents by drag-and-drop.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/move-button.png" alt="Delete Warning"></p>

<p>The "clone" button allows you to create another entry with the same information.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/clone-button.png" alt="Clone Button"></p>

<p>Most of the time you may want to create an entry from scratch. The "create" button at the top of the page will let you do this.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/create-button.png" alt="Create Button"></p>

<p>There you can also reload the page:</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/reload-button.png" alt="Reload Button"></p>

<p>Or filter entries to find what you are looking for:</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/search.png" alt="Search"></p>

<p>Entries will sometimes have other items attached to them. For example an article can have a list of images. Or Teams can then have a list of team members. These are called relationships.</p>

<p>When this is the case, you will have links for each relationship at the bottom of the entries and when you click on them, the system will bring you to another list page which follow the same structure.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/relationships.png" alt="Relationships"></p>

<p>Here this project has 3 tasks and 2 collaborators. You can click on any of these links to manage the tasks or the collaborators.</p>

<h1>Form</h1>

<p>Once you get to finally edit something, the page will be a form like the example below.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/form.png" alt="Form"></p>

<p>This page will probably be quite familiar to you. Field names within forms are devised to be as explicit as possible. For example they also include ideal image dimensions.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/image-dimensions.png" alt="Image Dimensions"></p>

<p>At the end of the form, you can either save or cancel.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/save-or-cancel.png" alt="Save or Cancel"></p>

<h1>Logout</h1>

<p>At the bottom of the menu you have a &quot;Logout&quot; button so that you can securely finish your working session.</p>

<p><img src="/admin/_static/img/help/logout.png" alt="Logout"></p>
